OrientedGraph
=============

Network Systems are potential candidates for fundamental theory of physics (see Chapter 9 of A New Kind of Science book by Stephen Wolfram).

This package contains utilities for enumerating, evolving and visualizing planar network systems, or oriented graphs.

Planar network systems were chosen because they are easier to study, yet there is a lot to study about them. Can deterministic planar network systems produce complex behavior starting from simple initial conditions? Can we represent particles as non planar defects in otherwise planar network, and what are the properties of such particles? What kind of manifolds evolution of planar network systems produces? How many rules of planar network systems evolution are universal?

This project attempts to answer these and other questions about planar network systems.
